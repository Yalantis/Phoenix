#Usage

*For a working implementation, Have a look at the Sample Project - sample*

1. Include the library as local library project.

    ``` compile 'com.yalantis:phoenix:1.2.3' ```

2. Include the PullToRefreshView widget in your layout.

	```xml
    <com.yalantis.phoenix.PullToRefreshView
        android:id="@+id/pull_to_refresh"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent">

        <ListView
            android:id="@+id/list_view"
            android:divider="@null"
            android:dividerHeight="0dp"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />

    </com.yalantis.phoenix.PullToRefreshView>
    ```

3. In your `onCreate` method refer to the View and setup OnRefreshListener.
	```java
    final PullToRefreshView mPullToRefreshView = (PullToRefreshView) findViewById(R.id.pull_to_refresh);
    mPullToRefreshView.setOnRefreshListener(new PullToRefreshView.OnRefreshListener() {
        @Override
        public void onRefresh() {
            mPullToRefreshView.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    mPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(false);
                }
            }, REFRESH_DELAY);
        }
     });
     ```
